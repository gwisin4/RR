%Conversion in Q6/Q7 (via Tustin) matched continuous-time design approximately but ignored exact discrete-time pole placement. 
% Direct digital design here guarantees that the closed-loop poles meet the discrete-time performance requirements.
% The main difference youâ€™ll observe: the step response now has overshoot close to 15% with the correct rise time, whereas the earlier Tustin-discretized controller may not have matched both at once.
